## A new round

You reviewed this branch before, and it has changed since: your checkout is now at the head this round reviews.

The commits since were made by another agent. Read them as new code: a change can break something outside the lines it touched — a caller, a contract, an error path, a test it weakened. Check what the change relies on and what relies on it, not only the lines in the range. Your earlier conclusions are not evidence: judge each finding by reading and running the code as it is now. Report anything new you find, wherever it is.

Report each finding as one YAML document, separated by `---`:

```yaml
severity: blocking | high | medium | low | note
category: <your review category>
repo: <the repository, when there are several>
file: path/to/file.ts
line: 123
title: One line naming the problem
description: What is wrong and why it matters.
suggested_fix: What to do instead.
```

Report nothing if you find nothing. A finding you are not confident in is a `note`, not a `blocking` — a reviewer that cries wolf costs the next fix attempt for nothing.

End your reply with a summary of the review, as one more YAML document; it is not a finding:

```yaml
review_summary:
  read: the code you read
  ran: each command you ran, and its result
  not_checked: what you could not check, and why
```
